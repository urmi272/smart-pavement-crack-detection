def apply_canny_edge_detection(image, low_threshold=50, high_threshold=150):
    """
    Apply Canny Edge Detection to find edges in the image.

    Canny edge detection uses two thresholds:
      - Pixels with gradient above high_threshold are strong edges.
      - Pixels between low and high are kept only if connected to strong edges.
      - Pixels below low_threshold are discarded.

    Parameters:
        image (numpy.ndarray): Input grayscale/blurred image.
        low_threshold (int): Lower threshold for edge detection.
        high_threshold (int): Upper threshold for edge detection.

        numpy.ndarray: Edge-detected binary image.

    Apply dilation to make detected edges (cracks) thicker and more visible.
    Dilation expands white (foreground) regions.
